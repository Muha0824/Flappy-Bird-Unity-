Hello everybody,

This is my first project of making a unity game using c#. 

And this is the starting ground, and will be made into better, and more userfriendly projects. 

You may use the code, as you please, but if you have made something cooler, pls add that to your github, and lets make the game much cooler, and fun to play.
